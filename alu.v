//For shift left and shift right (arithmetic as well as logical) for a 2 input ALU , which input will be the immediate value??
//Logical shift has no sign awareness where as Arithmetic shift has - more evident in case of right shift where we will have to
// extend by sign bit if it is a signed number.
//What if op1<op2? in case of subtract?
//How do I know whether an operand is signed or unsigned?
//If you use a signed instruction (slt, blt, div), 
//the hardware interprets operands as twoâ€™s complement signed integers.
//If you use an unsigned instruction (sltu, bltu, divu), the hardware interprets them as unsigned integers.
//what is the default value for slt x or 0? - I am setting as X as 0 gives a wrong information.
//What is the default operation expected?
//What is the o_result expectation when we check for slt and sltu?
