# Single-Cycle-Processor-RISC-V
A project that was done as part of ECE 552


# Guys Please Read this to know how to use Git!!! 🛐
I'll just go through the basic idea on what Git does so that you'll get a grasp on 
what it does and how to use it.

So, git is a version control system, which means you can control the version of
a folder. Sounds cool, eh, but git can do a lot more than that!

The folder that has git initialised is what we call a Repository. 
In order to download the project, you can use this command

> git clone https://github.com/ashvin-a/Single-Cycle-Processor-RISC-V.git

This will create a copy of the online repository that was created in your local machine.

Before starting your work, run this command and see if you are at the `main` branch.

> git branch

After that, run this command. This will create a new branch in your local machine.

> git checkout -b <branch_name>

If you want to upload the progress that you've worked on, do these commands

> git add . \
> git commit -m "This will be you commit message. Commit message should describe what you did."\
> git push origin <branch_name>

And before pushing, I'd suggest you to run this command
> git pull origin main

And btw, DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN! (Coding Standards).

If you have ANY DOUBTS, pleeeease call meeee!!!! 🫡
